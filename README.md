# WoofTabBarController 🐶
### (⚠️ A work in progress)
A custom tabbed view controller that mimics UITabBarController in implementation but provides a completely new UX.

## ToDos
[√] Add a configurations class that allows color, text and image customizations.

[√] Add a way to dynamically configure notification bubble.

[√] Add tabbing functionality. 

[->] Add tab switching delegates and completion handlers.

[.] Add more option in the example file.

[.] Handle portrait to landscape or landscape to protrait mode. Currently there is a bug that doesn't redraw the bezier when rotated to new orientation.
