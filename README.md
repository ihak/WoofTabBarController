# WoofTabBarController üê∂
### (‚ö†Ô∏è A work in progress)
A custom tabbed view controller that mimics UITabBarController in implementation but provides a completely new UX.

## ToDos
‚úÖ Add a configurations class that allows color, text and image customizations.
‚úÖ Add a way to dynamically configure notification bubble.
‚úÖ Add tabbing functionality. 
* Handle portrait to landscape or landscape to protrait mode. Currently there is a
bug that doesn't redraw the bezier when rotated to new orientation.
* Add tab switching delegates and completion handlers.
