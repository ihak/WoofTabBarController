# WoofTabBarController 🐶
### (⚠️ A work in progress)
A custom tabbed view controller that mimics UITabBarController in implementation but provides a completely new UX.

## ToDos
* Add a configurations class that allows color, text and image customizations.
* Add a way to dynamically configure notification bubble.
* Handle portrait to landscape or landscape to protrait mode. Currently there is a
bug that doesn't redraw the bezier when rotated to new orientation.
* Add tabbing functionality.
